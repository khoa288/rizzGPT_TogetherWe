            <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
                <p>TogetherWe is a small experiment in creating joyful micro-interactions that can serve as brief, positive interruptions in our day. The goal is to raise awareness about mental well-being through simple, accessible activities: laughter and movement.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8">The Social Context</h2>
                <p>Mental health challenges are universal, but access to support varies greatly. This project highlights the situations in Vietnam and Australia as examples of a global concern.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In <strong>Vietnam</strong>, a 2023 survey found that 1 in 5 adolescents (21.7%) reported a mental health problem in the past year, with anxiety being particularly prevalent (18.6%). However, only about 8.4% of those with a problem had accessed support services. [1, 2]</li>
                    <li>In <strong>Australia</strong>, recent data from 2020-22 shows that approximately 1 in 5 people (22%) aged 16-85 experienced a mental disorder in the past year, with anxiety affecting 17% of the population. [3, 4]</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8">The Power of Laughter & Movement</h2>
                <p>While technology is not a substitute for professional care, it can help promote behaviors known to support well-being. The two modes in this game are based on established principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Large-scale reviews confirm that physical exercise, especially brisk aerobic activity, is a highly effective, well-tolerated treatment for improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression. [5, 6] The "Shake" mode encourages a brief burst of such activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laughter:</strong> Meta-analyses have shown that laughter and humor-based interventions can significantly reduce both depression and anxiety across various populations. [7] The "Laugh" mode uses on-device machine learning to encourage and "score" genuine laughter. [8]</li>
                </ul>
